This is a guide on how to install Pfsense into your VMware ESXI lab environment. After installation and configuration, this will replace my Netgear AC1900 Router. Afterwards, I will convert the router into a simple access point. I am in need of a more robust solution for network segmentation and security controls, so I am choosing to use Pfsense instead. Also, itâ€™s a great learning experience. This is actually not my first time using Pfsense, I previously had a virtual Pfsense instance configured as my primary firewall/router, however I was having a lot of issues with the USB NICs that were being used previously. To replace these NICs and add more stability to the system, I decided to purchase a dedicated quad port PCIe NIC.  

I am currently running ESXI on an Optiplex 7010 (16GB of RAM w/ a 2TB HDD), with a Quad port Gigabit NIC (HP NC364T). This whole setup can be had relatively inexpensively. If you want to copy my setup, you can scour eBay for a good deal for the PC and NIC.
