## Start Here:

[TryHackMe](tryhackme.com/)
-TryHackMe is perfect for complete beginners that have no experience whatsoever. However, this platform also has a lot of content for intermediate/advanced users as well. The "complete beginner" learning path is the perfect place to start, and it covers some of the fundamentals like networking, Linux, and web protocols. It also introduces users to Cryptography, exploitation, privilege escalation, and helps you get familiar with some of the tools of the trade. They also have a very active discord channel, where you can go and ask questions, get help, or just goof off with other people with the same interests.

[Black Cyber-Security Association](https://blackcybersecurityassociation.org/)
-The BCA (Black Cyber-Security Association) aims to close the diversity gap in Cyber-Security and tech in general. They have Certification prep groups, clubhouse talks, home-lab tutorials, a very active discord, and are becoming a very prominent force in the Cyber-Security community. This is a group where you can find a mentor, volunteer your time, and become a part of something greater than yourself. The BCA is also inclusive, meaning that anyone can join. Amazing people and fantastic work being done by these people. 10/10 – HIGHLY recommend. 

[TCM Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/)
-This platform is also highly recommended. Heath Adams AKA “The Cyber Mentor” is well respected in the infosec community and aims to provide quality & practical content that is also very affordable. The Cyber Mentor produces great content and is an amazing teacher.
