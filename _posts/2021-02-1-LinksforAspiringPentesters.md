-TryHackMe is perfect for complete beginners that have no experience whatsoever, this platform also has a lot of content for intermediate/advanced users as well. The "complete beginner" learning path is the perfect place to start, and it covers some of the fundamentals like networking, Linux, and web protocols. It also introduces users to Cryptography, exploitation, privilege escalation, and helps you get familiar with some of the tools of the trade.
